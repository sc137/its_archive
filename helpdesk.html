<p>We support you through our help desk system.  Please call, send e-mail, or log-in to submit a ticket.</p>

<h2>Help Desk Management System</h2>

<p>ITS logs and tracks support requests through an online system called the Help Desk Management System.  Once you login you will be able to create new tickets or track the status of existing tickets.</p>

<p>Access the <a href="http://helpdesk.riohondo.edu" target="_blank" title="Click here to go to the Help Desk Management System.">Help Desk Management System</a>.</p>

<p>Log-in with your network account (this is the same account you log-in to your computer with and check your e-mail).</p>

<a href="images/helpdesk_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/helpdesk_1.png"></a>

<p>Create a new ticket right from the site by entering a title and description of the problem.  You can even attach screen shots or other support documents.  This works even when your e-mail isn't working.</p>

<a href="images/helpdesk_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/helpdesk_2.png" width="500"></a>

<p>A list of your open tickets will be on the same page and will include the ticket status and any comments from ITS staff.  You will be able to check on the status or add status updates to the ticket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I emailed the help desk and they won&#8217;t get back to me!!!!&#8221; - Jon</p>

<p>&#8220;I left a voice mail, but the help desk never gets back to me..&#8221; - Jane</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting support from the help desk is vital to your day to day job. The reports need to be printed but something is terribly wrong with the printer. You have to get to a file on your computer and you can&#8217;t log-on. You are about to make a huge presentation and your laptop won&#8217;t work with the projector. It happens. We&#8217;re here to help.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re here to help and there are a lot of help requests. Here are some tips to help us help you faster.</p>

<h3 id="writeadescriptivesummary">Write a Descriptive Summary</h3>

<p>Use wording in the subject of your email or the summary of the web form that states what the specific problem is and what you are seeing. Try using something like this:</p>

<p><code>Cannot log in to computer. Says account is locked
</code></p>

<p>Instead of this:</p>

<p><code>Help, computer problem???
</code></p>

<p>When the help desk team looks at the first ticket they can immediately route it to someone who can assist with a log in or account issue. The second line requires us to open the ticket and read the details. </p>

<p>Examples of descriptive summaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers are not working in A 223</li>
<li>Phone is not working in room SS 254</li>
<li>Cannot login to my computer in room B119</li>
<li>I cannot access Jane&#8217;s calendar today. It worked yesterday.</li>
<li>Website X is loading very slowly. Others seem to work.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="putdetailsinthedetailssection">Put Details in the Details Section</h3>

<p>In the body of the email (or the details section of the web form) put all the relevant details to the problem such as the room the problem is occuring in, the specific computer, printer, desk, projector, etc. and the time that the problem occurs. Anything you may know that is relevant will help our team get to this faster. Try to include</p>

<ul>
<li>What you were doing when the problem happened?</li>
<li>When was the last time this worked (if ever)?</li>
<li>Does this happen every time you do X?</li>
<li>The room number.</li>
<li>The specific computer or telephone.</li>
<li>When did you first notice this?</li>
<li>What was supposed to happen, but didn&#8217;t?</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to include your contact information such as your email or a phone number we can reach you at. Having the information ready makes it easier for the help desk team to contact you.</p>

<h3 id="followup">Follow Up</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My ticket has been open for three days and no one has contacted me yet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do our best to answer tickets as they come in. Sometimes we are faster than others. Often times we try to contact the ticket creator by email or voicemail and wait to hear back about a clarification. A good way to follow up on your ticket is to login to the <a href="http://helpdesk.riohondo.edu">help desk system</a> and update your ticket. You can also email us with the ticket number. Creating a new help desk ticket requesting an update to another help desk ticket will take extra time for the team member looking up the information.</p>
