<p>This is a do-it-yourself class!</p>

<p>Please specifically tell people that you plan to email them when they sign-up, opt-in, or otherwise give you their email address. </p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Using Mailchimp is a vast and complex topic. We could spend eight hours going through step-by-step and still not understand every feature. We don't need to understand every feature.</p>

<p>This workshop is about getting started and completing a few basic tasks:</p>

<ul><li>Creating a Mail Chimp Account
<li>Creating a List
<li>Inputting users into a List
<li>Creating a Campaign
<li>Sending a Campaign
<li>Viewing Campaign Reports
</li></ul>
<h2>What is mailchimp and why do we want to use an email service?</h2>
<blockquote><p>"I have outlook, why not just send out email?"</p></blockquote>

<p>We want to make communicating easier, better, and more reliable. We spend much of our time reading and writing email that is important to our work. We want to notify and inform </p>

<p>MailChimp is an email newsletter service. You give them a list of people and a message and they send it. The market for email list providers is rich and other good companies such as Vertical Response, Constant Contact, iContact, and more. We are looking at MailChimp for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ul><li>They offer a good free program: up to 2,000 recipients and up to 12,000 messages. That will cover most of our community and classroom needs.
<li>MailChimp has a mature and feature rich interface. It does what we need it to do.
<li>MailChimp is an established company with a good reputation. Should we decide to move forward with a premium account we won't have to research a new provider.
<li>MailChimp is integrated with many other services and has solid API support.
<li>MailChimp has excellent documentation and support.
<li>MailChimp has well designed templates to make our messages look good without hiring a designer.
</li></ul>
<h2>Using MailChimp in the Classroom</h2>
<p>So how does this all boil down to me using newsletters for teaching or with my organization?</p>

<ul><li>Get students and colleagues to opt-in
<ul><li>	Put a sign-up form on the web or via email and get people to join your list. That list will contain real email addresses and you can go to one place to message them all. If a student or colleague decides they don't want updates anymore they can opt out any time without asking you to change your address book.
</li></ul><li>Use a list to organize emailing groups of students from the area whether they use a college email or not.
<li>Use a list to email all the people in your Mac Users Group or little league team.
<li>Put a sign-up form on your website for people who want to be notified when a class or program becomes available.
<li>Isn't this just email marketing?
<ul><li>	Are you selling something?
</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>I personally use mailchimp to communicate with my students at GWC. I teach part-time over there and each student has to sign-up on my list in order to get the course information. I explain that email is how the real world works today and that's what I will use with them.</p>

<h1>Enough Talk, Let's Get Started</h1>

<h2>Create an Account</h2>
<p>Our account is how we will login to mailchimp.com and manage our account including:</p>
<ul><li>sending campaigns
<li>viewing reports
<li>creating lists
</li></ul>
<p>Let's go over to <a href="http://mailchimp.com" title="">mailchimp.com</a> and sign-up for the free account. Click on the big Sign Up Free button. Choose a good password and then check your email to confirm the account. Then login.</p>

<p>Use the Rio Hondo address and not your personal address. This information will go out to every recipient.</p>

<h2>Create a List</h2>
<p>This is the group of addresses that we will send email to.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-do-i-create-a-new-list" title="">Create a new list</a></em></p>

<p>From the Dashboard, select Lists >> Create List. Enter descriptive information about this list of subscribers. </p>

<p>Be explicit with the Permission Reminder. People will often click on the link that says "why am I receiving this email?". It will help to say "You subscribed at ILoveMath.net" or "You completed an informational questionnaire at the Science Mania Camp 2011".</p>

<p>What about groups?</p>

<p><strong>Getting addresses into the list</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to get email addresses and names into a list. </p>

<ul><li>Use a form.
<ul><li>	You signed up for this class by filling out a form. The form opted you in to the workshop list, which we are using for attendance.
</li></ul><li>Manually enter addresses.
<ul><li>	We can type addresses in manually for a short list.
</li></ul><li>Import a tab delimited CSV file.
<li>Copy / Paste from Excel.
<li>Import directly from Google or other Apps.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Optional: Setup Archiving</strong></p>

<h2>Create a Campaign</h2>
<p>A campaign is the message that we will send to our list. This could be a short update or a beautiful newsletter.</p>

<p>Go to the campaign dashboard.</p>

<p>Go to Campaigns >> Create Campaigns >> Regular Ol' Campaign</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<ul><li>Choose the list of recipients or start a new list.
<li>Setup the campaign with the subject line, reply email, organizational address, etc.
<li>Advanced features such as facebook like and comments, twitter notification, etc.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>Choose a template to accomodate your information. For testing, I'll choose a 1 column Basic Template. Click to start typing.</p>

<p><strong>Inbox Inspection</strong> </p>
<p>Let's you see what your message will look like in different email clients.</p>

<p><strong>Organize Campaign's by Folder</strong></p>
<p>Use folders to segment off courses, terms, on or off campus events, etc.</p>

<h2>Send a Campaign</h2>
<p>Send yourself a test message. Send your friend a test messages.</p>
<ul><li>Read it out loud.
<li>Ask for corrections / suggestions (even if you don't use them)
</li></ul>
<p>Hit send and watch the stats.</p>

<p>If the campaign has been sent, you will see a Social Share icon and the stats will update.</p>

<h2>Check Your Metrics (Overview of Reports)</h2>
<p>Mailchimp's tracking and reporting tools will help you tune your campaigns.</p>

<p>Compare against others in the industry.</p>

<p>See how many people open the message, how many forwards, clicks, unsubscribes, etc. This is really good in the classroom!</p>

<p>Download stats as an excel spreadsheet to show off.</p>
