<h1>The Dropbox Tour</h1>

<p>From the dropbox site: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/tour/0">https://www.dropbox.com/tour/0</a></p>

<h2>What is Dropbox?</h2>

<p>A service that syncs your documents, photos, and videos between computers and provides some very simple sharing tools. You can get your files from your synced computers, most phones, or the website.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>There is a folder on your computer. Everything in that folder syncs. When you share a folder, everything in <em>that</em> folder syncs with the person you are sharing with!</p>

<h3>Why use dropbox?</h3>

<p>All the files you need, available wherever you have a network connection. Work on your presentation at home, finish it in the office, present in the classroom. Check it on the phone. Email it to your people with a simple link. Never forget to copy or email yourself the files or the "right one" (current version).</p>

<h3>Sharing?</h3>

<p>Dropbox allows you to share files in a couple of simple ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send files that are in your dropbox by right-clicking and choosing "get link" then emailing the link (or IM, etc)</li>
<li>Invite a collaborator to share a folder with you. Everything in the folder is on all the shared computers, instantly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extras and Side Bene's</h3>

<p>Dropbox is backing up those files that are synced. It's also keeping 30 days of versions so if your important presentation <em>accidentally</em> gets a few slides erased, you can go back into the dropbox archive and get that version from last week.</p>

<h3>What Should I NOT Sync?</h3>

<p>Dropbox provides a web-enabled service and <em>must</em> be able to look into your data in order to do that. For that reason we avoid putting personally identifiable information about students or other sensitive organizational information on dropbox.</p>

<h2>Account Creation</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="http://dropbox.com">dropbox.com</a> and create an account. You will need to validate your email address and make note of your password.</p>

<h2>Installing Dropbox</h2>

<p>Dropbox works best when it is installed on your local computer. You can work with your favorite applications and keep your data in the dropbox folder. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">magic</a> those files will be synced and backed up - ready for sharing.</p>

<h3>Full Install</h3>

<p>Use the full install on your own computers. One at the office and one at home. Maybe even your laptop. All your dropbox folders will be there.</p>

<h3>Advanced Install</h3>

<p>The advanced install let's you specify folders that should and should not sync. Use this in the classrooms you regularly teach in and have a login for. </p>

<h2>Saving to Dropbox</h2>

<p>Move files to the dropbox folder on your computer. Use the File → Save As.. command to save to the dropbox folder. Make folders within the dropbox folder.</p>

<h2>The Dropbox Website</h2>

<p>The dropbox website is the central location of your files and account information. You can access all of your files from the website. You can check your account status</p>

<h2>Sharing a File</h2>

<p>dropbox has a nice looking, full browser, document viewer. When you use the Get Public Link option for your .docx or .pdf documents the recipient can view the entire file in the browser - even if they don't have office or a pdf viewer.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/771080eq7w4uilg/Viewing%20Test%20-%20PDF.pdf">PDF</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxgcv75784cbbde/Viewing%20Test%20-%20DOCX.docx">Word (.docx)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhso634qfocgsyq/Viewing%20Test%20-%20PowerPoint.pptx">PowerPoint (.pptx)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qurp888w7f52j31/Viewing%20Test%20-%20Excel.xlsx">Excel (.xlsx) you must download the file</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing a Folder</h2>

<p>Use this feature when you are working with another person, or a team of people, on a documents together. Everyone will have an exact copy of the folder on their computers and all changes saved will sync.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/19/en">From dropbox: How do I share a folder?</a></p>

<p>What would this look like?</p>

<ul>
<li>Two instructors co-teaching a class keep all presentations, notes, and resources together</li>
<li>Share pictures with your friend / spouse / children for events</li>
<li>Setup student group folders and have each student save all work into the group folder. Open the folder on your computer to check group progress.</li>
<li>You are providing screenshots for someone building a website.</li>
<li>You are saving research for a shared paper.</li>
<li>And anything you can think of …</li>
</ul>

<h3>What about file conflicts?</h3>

<p>If both people sharing a folder make changes to a file at the same time there will be a conflict. dropbox will save BOTH files. The first person to save will get the change and the second person will see "Scott's Conflicted copy 2012-07-15". You will have to compare the changes manually to ensure that your data is safe.</p>

<h2>Photos &amp; Video</h2>

<p>Dropbox provides a very nice view for your photos online. Copy photos from your camera (or let dropbox do it for you) and put them in the Photos folder.</p>

<p>When the pictures are in the Photos folder you can use the Get Link button to view the photo gallery. Like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j8it2f1x5byomxl/xIYdqOC64N">this one</a> of my cute kids playing in the yard.</p>

<p>Dropbox has a builtin video player as well. Put your video file anywhere in your dropbox and send the link. Your video will play within the browser.</p>

<h2>The Public Link</h2>

<p>You can create a link to any file within your dropbox folder that can be downloaded by anyone. </p>

<p>Save your syllabus to the course folder and email the dropbox public link to your students.</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p>Sync text notes that you can get anywhere. Using <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">NVAlt</a>, or <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html">Resoph Notes</a> on your computers is a great way to keep quick info available. Tie that in with any of the numerous <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">iOS</a> and Android apps (like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kooklab.epistle&amp;hl=en">epistle</a> )that sync to Dropbox for quick mobile access.</p>

<p>Use the Invite to Dropbox feature shamelessly. A few GB of syncing might be enough for all of your class material or non-sensitive team material</p>

<p>Share a folder in the Photo folder to get everyones pictures from an event.</p>

<p>If you create html websites or pages you can put them into the dropbox, using relative links, and it will work just like a normal website.</p>
