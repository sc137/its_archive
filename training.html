		<a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">http://mailchimp.com/</a></p>
		
		<p>Notes for this workshop can be found <a href="notes_mailchimp.html">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>What is MailChimp?</strong></p>
		
		<p><blockquote>"MailChimp helps you design email newsletters, share them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track your results. It's like your own personal publishing platform"</blockquote></p>
		
		<p><strong>Why do I need this workshop?</strong><br />
		
			MailChimp is an email list service.  We can use MailChimp to setup sign-up forms for events, newsletters, assignments, blog updates, etc. The recipients give their preferred email address and then you send out an email (known as a campaign) to the subscribers.  Then you get metrics about delivery, bounce rate, who opened the message, etc.</p>
			
		<p><strong>What will I do in the workshop?</strong><br />
		
			This workshop is going to walk through the entire process from setting up an account to evaluating metrics on our first campaign.</p>
		
		<p><strong>What do I need for this workshop?</strong><br />
		
			Two email addresses: one to sign up with and one to send test messages to. We'll provide the computers and the patience. </p>

		<blockquote ><p>Notes for this workshop are <a href="notes_dropbox.html">here.</a></p></blockquote>
		
		<p><strong>What is Dropbox?</strong></p>
		
		<p><blockquote>"Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring your photos, docs, and videos anywhere and share them easily."</blockquote></p>
		
		<p><strong>Why do I need this workshop?</strong><br />
		
			If you have ever worked collaboratively on documents, or sync documents between multiple computers, or send large files to people, dropbox might be for you.</p>
			
		<p><strong>What will I do in the workshop?</strong><br />
		
			In this workshop, we will create an account at dropbox.com and walk through the steps of several tasks including: installing dropbox on a computer, sharing a folder with another user to collaborate with, sharing files that others can only read or download, creating a simple photo gallery, and sharing dropbox to get more free space.</p>
		
		<p><strong>What do I need for this workshop?</strong><br />
		
			You will need to sign up for dropbox with an email address and keep track of the password you use with dropbox.com </p>

		<p><blockquote>"Create, share, and collaborate on the web with documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and more"</blockquote></p>
		
		<p><strong>Why do I need this workshop?</strong><br />
		
			If you want to collaborate on documents in the cloud and from any computer, or if you ever need to open obscure file types, or don't own office software, Google Docs might be the right tool for you.</p>

	LR 128</p>

	<p>Watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/aleph_molinari_let_s_bridge_the_digital_divide.html">the video</a>.</p>
	<p>Follow along with <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=1grNW7G81MNr0stxtyIcrYi_yj72evXWcG5oDHjHnhFU&start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">the presentation slides</a>.</p>
	
	<br />

<h2>Banner Navigation Training</h2>

<p>Banner Navigation Training is required for new users of Internet Native Banner and is available upon request.  Please obtain and complete a Banner security form prior to scheduling training. Banner Navigation Training usually takes 1hr 30min to 2hr to complete the training and the testing.</p>

<p>You will receive your account shortly after successfully completing Banner Navigation Training.  The security form will be submitted to the appropriate supervisor who assigns access privileges and then our support team will activate the account and notify you via e-mail.</p>

<p>Banner Navigation Training is not required for faculty using AccessRio.</p>


<h2>Virtual Office Hours</h2>	

<p>IT Training will be holding virtual office hours throughout the semester using <a href="http://www.cccconfer.org/index2.aspx" target="_blank" title="Click here to go to the CCCConfer website">CCCConfer</a> web-conferencing.</p>

<p>The idea behind virtual office hours is that we can have small groups and/or individuals pop-in for a specific question such as "how can I make my powerpoint file size smaller?" or "How do I archive my Outlook PST file?".  Using CCCConfer for the virtual office hours allows part-time and off-campus staff members an easy way to utilize our training resources.</p>

<p>No virtual office hours are scheduled at this time.</p>

<h2>Virtual Training</h2>

<p>We provide over-the-phone and webinar style support for requested training using both CCCConfer and Team Viewer. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to schedule a virtual training.</p>
	
<h2>SARS Software Products</h2>

<p>We provide installation and usage support for SARS-GRID, SARS-TRAK, eSARS, and Counselor's Grid on campus.  Please contact the help desk with your specific issue. Please indicate the computer name and location if you are requesting software installation.</p>
